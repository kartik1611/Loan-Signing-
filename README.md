# Loan-Signing-

Lending companies work by analyzing the financial history of their loan applicants and they choose whether or not the applicant is risky or not too risky.
and if they're not risky at all then they give them a loan.Now let's summarize this the market in which we're working is the set of all applicants who reachedout through an intermediary 
marketplace so all the applicants are coming through these P2P lending marketplaces.In this project we are not all concerned with the product itself we're concerned with the quality of the applicants that we're getting.
Now the exact goal is to develop a model of course to predict the quality of applicants so in this case we're calling quality applicants as those who reach a particular screen.
